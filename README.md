# Football_player_Marketvalue_Prediction

## Data
The project uses FIFA player data from various years (2009 to 2022) to train the predictive models. The dataset is provided in CSV format.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Merging data from multiple years.
Handling missing values.
Dropping irrelevant columns.
Converting data types.
## Model Building
Four different regression models are built and compared:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Multiple Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
## Performance Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using various metrics, including:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R2) Score
## Results
The project includes visualizations of model performance, such as scatter plots, residual plots, and distribution plots.

## Usage
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
Run the code to build and evaluate predictive models.
Model files (e.g., fifa1.pkl) are generated and can be used for predictions.
